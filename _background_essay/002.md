###  Background:

Even though his primary occupation was that of notary, Matteo Dei Libri (1214-1275) was highly invested in teaching the _ars dictamini_. From his pedagogical experiences, he published four volumes with instructions on how to write letters and other private and public documents: three in Latin and one in the vernacular. The item presented here is an acephalous Tuscan vernacular copy of his _Formulario di allocuzioni_ (also known as _Arringhe_ or _Dicerie_), and it includes twenty out of sixty-six model speeches recorded in other surviving sources. Its old pagination (cc.203-227, of which cc.221-220 are lost leaving _arringa_ XI and XII only partially transcribed) clearly signals that it was originally part of a larger book project. The order in which the speeches are transcribed is rather unique, and its scribe’s name is recorded in the colophon: “[…] Zucherus manus scriptoris salvetur omnibus horis” (c.227r, now 17r). The _Formulario_ covers a wide range of potential public and private scenarios: just to quote two examples, it suggests what to say when electing a new governor (_podestà_), calling him to be just and reasonable, noble in spirit (and with good intentions, serving and hearing both the poor and the rich) and not simply in title (c.1r); or how a _capitano_ of a land should suggest a _podestà_ (governor) to lead by example, with reason and steadiness, in troubled times (c.11r). <br>
Newberry VAULT Case MS 27.1 was purchased in 1951 from renowned antiquarian Hans Peter Kraus. The Strozzi ducal coat-of-arms is stamped on the armorial binding, a sign of possession, at least from the time when the book was rebound (see image above).

The Newberry manuscript is not mentioned in the 1974 edition of the _Arringhe_, which includes variants of the eight manuscripts known by the author at the time (among them MS Laurenziano [Pluteo 76.74](http://mss.bmlonline.it/s.aspx?Id=AWOMMhRwI1A4r7GxMRHe&c=catalogo#/book)).  The entire transcription of the Newberry’s thirty-three speeches can be found in Cherchi’s 1979 essay.

###  Script:

Gotica, informale, tipica per testi in italiano.<br>
Da notare: il contrasto, la spezzatura e la sovrapposizione delle curve moderati; lo slancio delle aste; la _a_ di tipo corsivo (1r, r. 1: _quando_); la _g_ in più forme (1r, r. 10: _già è gra(n)di_); le aste molto allungate e dotate di elementi ornamentali nel primo e ultimo rigo (11r).<br>
