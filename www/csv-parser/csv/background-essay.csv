31,A nosseigneurs de la Cour des Aydes [calligraphy sample: mock legal document],1,"<p>This mock document presents an appeal supposedly brought to the <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/content/french-institutions"">Paris Cour des Aides</a> (Court of Aids) in a matter of debt inheritance. The scribe used the handwriting style of Louis Barbedor, author of two calligraphy copybooks. As a member of the corporation of <em>maîtres écrivains jurés</em> in Paris, Barbedor belonged to a group of experts who taught handwriting and also examined documents, signatures, and accounts suspected of forgery in the courts of justice. When the Parlement of Paris standardized handwriting models in 1633, Barbedor’s <em>lettre financière</em> (or <em>ronde</em>) was selected as one of the two standard scripts. Our later document thus exemplifies a script used in many kinds of official documents.</p>
<p>Here we find a complex fictional case, using improbable proper names based on the repetition of fundamental writing strokes (minims and curls). On behalf of the estate of Pierre de La Renouveauviere, Antoine de Mommiromouvant requests payment of 647 <em>livres </em>from Jacqueline de Vaumirouvieux to honor a debt contracted by her father, Edme de Guermouvois, and passed on to her upon his death. Jacqueline refuses to pay the sum, and presents evidence that Edme did incur a debt of 647 <em>livres</em>, but that the amount is owed to the royal treasury, rather than to Pierre's estate, because of Edme’s work as a tax collector in Vaumommoré and Sainct-Amour.</p>
<p>A model for this document, “A Nosseigneurs de Parlement,” appears in Barbedor’s large <em>Escritures financiere, et italienne-bastarde dans leur naturel</em>, first published in 1647. In the edition from circa 1660 that we have digitized, that plate appears on<a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography%3A527#page/16/mode/1up""> page 6</a>.</p>

33,Aveu et dénombrement de la seigneurie de Taillepied,838,"<p>In medieval France, when a vassal gained possession of a fiefdom, generally through purchase or inheritance, he participated in an homage ceremony in which he pledged submission to his lord. Then, within 40 days, he was obligated to provide a written declaration -- an <em>aveu</em> -- confirming the homage. This document was often accompanied by a <em>dénombrement</em>, a detailed list of the possessions the vassal held from his lord, with a statement of each party's rights and obligations.</p>
<p>In the document presented here, vassal and lord both happen to be widows. Probably the <em>aveu</em> was made when Robine Bordinelle lost her husband Thomas Peigné, and thus gained possession of the fiefdom of Taillepied. Possibly due to old age or illness, Bordinelle deputized her son Pierre to perform in her name the ceremonies of homage and provide the <em>aveu et dénombrement</em> for each of Peigné's possessions.</p>
<p>The document opens with Pierre's <em>aveu</em> on behalf of his mother for the fiefdom of Taillepied, owned by Catherine de La Fontaine, lady of Verers and Taillepied, and widow of Jacques de Mainbier (fol. 1r). Next follows an extensive <em>dénombrement</em> pertaining to a long series of parcels of land (fol. 1v-16v).</p>

39,Déclaration de Michel Mercier de tenue en bourgage de sa maison a Alencon,838,"<p>Noticing the words ""tient, confesse et advoue tenir"" and ""sont subjects faire foy et hommage,"" one might conclude that this document is an <em>aveu</em>, the written declaration a vassal in pre-modern France provided to his lord upon gaining possession of a fiefdom through purchase or inheritance. Yet this is not the case here, as the asset in question was not held by nobles; rather, the declaration comes from a free man, a <em>bourgeois</em>, living in a city.</p>
<p>In Normandy’s civil customs, free men could own land and buildings in cities such as Rouen, Bayeux, and Alençon, provided they paid a modest tax to the king every year. This type of ownership was called <em>bourgage</em> or <em>bourgage-alleu</em> (in this text, ""bourgaige et alleu""). Upon gaining posession of a property, new owners would provide a written declaration to the local tax collecting bureau specifying its location and boundaries, as well as the amount of the yearly tax to be paid and the amount of the fine to be incurred if they failed to pay.</p>
<p>Here, Michel Mercier and his siblings are inheriting from their father Pierre a house and a flour mill in the city of Alençon. The house is on the ""rue à la Personne"" and sits between the properties of the Langlois and the Du Bois families. The tax is set at 20 <em>sous tournois</em> to be paid to the <em>prévôté</em> of Alençon every year, on the Feast of the Nativity of the Virgin. The fine for non-payment would be 60 <em>sous tournois</em>.</p>
<p>The document, unsigned and undated, is most certainly a draft, written on a low-quality piece of parchment when Pierre Mercier died, at some point during the reign of King Henry III of France (1574-1589). Pierre's father, Jean, a merchant and breadmaker, had purchased the flour mill, so it had been in the Mercier family for two generations.</p>

40,Charitable donation of land to benefit the poor of Quebec City,838,"<p>This document records the donation of 40 <em>arpents</em> of land on the Saint Lawrence River, to benefit the poor. The recipients of the donation were two nuns, representatives of a nursing Order, the Hospitallers of the Order of Saint Augustine, also known as the Daughters of Mercy. Mother Marie de Saint Bonaventure de Jésus (Marie Forestier, 1615-1698) was Superior of the Hospitallers of Quebec in 1665; she had been one of the three founders of the Hôtel-Dieu (hospital) there in 1639. Also accepting the donation on behalf of the poor was Sister Marie de la Nativité (Marie-Renée Boulée, 1630-1677).</p>
<p>The plots of land owned by settlers along the Saint Lawrence were long and narrow, to allow for as many properties as possible to front on the river. So the plot donated here, as explained in the document, was 2 <em>arpents</em> wide (some 100 meters of river-front) and 40 <em>arpents</em> deep (that is, extending quite far from the river, close to a mile and a half, as measured today). It bordered on land already managed by the Hospitallers, as well as on some land that had apparently not yet been granted to a settler. The document attaches certain conditions to the donation of the land, in that the Sisters were granted the use of it but were required to pay some taxes to the Lauson family.</p>
<p>The donor, Charles de Lauson de Charny (1629-1689), was the son of Jean de Lauson, who had been appointed governor of New France in 1651. In 1656 Jean returned to France and his son Charles served as acting governor for a brief time. However, Charles too returned to France, in 1657, following the death of his young wife. He became a priest and returned to Quebec a couple of years later, accompanying Monsignor de Laval, sent to be the first bishop of Quebec. Charles de Lauson remained in New France until 1671. Gradually, over the years, before his final departure from the colony, Charles divested himself of all of his holdings in New France. The 1665 donation of land to “the poor” came in the wake of his appointment the year before as ecclesiastical superior of the Hôtel-Dieu. By this time, as the document indicates, he was serving as guardian to the children of his older brother, Jean, who had been killed in 1661 during an attack by Iroquoian Indians on the Ile d’Orléans.</p>
<p>One of the signatories to this document, Jacques de la Metairie (“Lameterie”), would later accompany Cavelier de la Salle in his voyage of exploration along the Mississippi River.</p>

41,"Chroniques de Jean Froissart, vol. 1",838,"<p>Though Jean Froissart began his career as a poet and continued to compose verse works throughout his life, he is best known for his great historical work, the <em>Chroniques</em>. This monumental text is an account of the major events and battles that occurred in Western Europe from the ascension of King Edward III of England in 1327 up to the death of Edward’s grandson and successor, Richard II, in 1400.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Froissart was born in Valenciennes around 1337. He entered the service of the counts of Hainault and later became a clerk of the court of Queen Philippa, wife of Edward III. In his role as clerk, he traveled frequently and undertook diplomatic missions on the queen’s behalf. After her death in 1369, Froissart returned to Hainault, where he began to chronicle the events of the previous half-century. The <em>Chroniques</em> draw on numerous existing historical sources (<em>Les</em> <em>Grandes Chroniques de France</em>, <em>Les</em> <em>Vrayes Chroniques de Jean le Bel</em>, <em>La Vie du Prince noir </em>by Herald Chandos, etc.) but Froissart also made extensive use of oral sources, namely vivid descriptions of events provided by participants and eyewitnesses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wars, funerals, ceremonies, and royal entries feature prominently in the chronicle, indicating that it was primarily intended for an aristocratic audience. Over 100 manuscripts of the <em>Chroniques </em>survive today as a testimony to the text’s popularity in the later medieval period and to Jean Froissart’s reputation during his lifetime. Although it includes occasional errors in chronology and geography, Froissart’s <em>Chroniques</em> is still considered one of the most important sources for the history of Europe in the 14<sup>th</sup> century, especially the Hundred Years’ War.</p>

43,Commentaries on William Rastell's Collection of all the statutes,838,"<p>William Rastell was an English printer and lawyer, active in the first half of the sixteenth century. A nephew of Thomas More, he began his career as a printer, but then turned to the law instead. As a Catholic, he was forced to flee England twice, once in 1549 during the ascension of King Edward VI, and again in 1563 during Queen Elizabeth’s reign.</p>
<p>This manuscript is a set of commentaries on <em>A Collection of All the Statutes</em> (1557), an important law book edited and published by Rastell, containing statutes from the <em>Magna Carta</em> to 1557. The commentaries are believed to have been compiled somewhere in France around 1600 and possibly earlier.</p>

44,Composition de toutes sortes de feux artificiels,838,"<p>This compilation of instructions on how to make fireworks was a gift of the family of the Canadian historian of science Stillman Drake (1910-1993) to the Fisher Library at the University of Toronto. Drake, renowned for his many publications on Galileo Galilei, led a distinguished career as a professor at the university’s Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology. By the time this manuscript was created, around the year 1600, the Chinese had been making fireworks for some 800 years and Europeans for some 300 years. In France, the development of fireworks was strongly influenced by Italian theatrical directors and pyrotechnicians. Prior to the middle of the seventeenth century, throughout Europe it was often difficult to separate the military use of fireworks (“pour la guerre”) from their peaceful use (“pour la joie”). Information about recreative fireworks often appears in sections inserted into early books on warfare and artillery.</p>

<p>By the end of the sixteenth century fireworks had become associated with many aspects of intellectual and courtly life, including alchemy (the creation of artificial stars and of seemingly animate beings), the liberal arts (via associations with geometry, natural philosophy, and the idea of ingenious invention), and theatrical performance (the development of allegorical content for displays). The texts included in the Drake manuscript are addressed to would-be gunners who wish to make recreative fireworks (“artifices de joieuseté, et de plaisir”), or simply learned readers who want to understand how pyrotechnics are made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The manuscript opens with a short treatise in French and continues with a longer treatise in Dutch, which includes numerous drawings in the margins. This is followed by a compilation (in French again) of information drawn from a half-dozen different texts, whose authors are identified by initials in the margins and, in a few instances, chapter numbers. Finally, the anthology concludes with a short printed set of instructions in Dutch. Once a complete transcription of the manuscript has been produced, the texts and drawings might be profitably compared with Schorndorff Schmidlap’s <em>Künstliche und rechtschaffene fewerwerick zum schimpff</em> (Nuremberg, 1560), the first German work on fireworks and earliest published work devoted to fireworks for entertainment, which was reprinted several times and translated into Dutch in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The scribe who prepared the manuscript tends to flourishes, which, for instance, sometimes make words look like they are plural, with an S, when in fact they are not. A catchword is included at the bottom of each recto page, to ensure that the leaves of the compilation would be kept in the correct order.</p>

45,De l'occasion et de la fortune,838,"<p>This philosophical text reflects on the potential impact on society of different kinds of personal beliefs about chance and fortune. It appears in a manuscript containing a series of meditations on government, intended to provide advice to rulers, compiled in about 1580, which the Newberry Library purchased in 1985. The author has not been identified. See below for a rough English translation of the first paragraph presented in the section that we have digitized.</p>

","<p>There are some men who are so taken with their own importance that if they hear it said that fortune has some authority over human affairs, they laugh at this. And there are others who are so mistrustful of themselves (or through cowardice, or for having seen that an infinity of people with little merit nonetheless enjoy good fortune) that they hold human industriousness to be useless and in vain, and believe that all depends upon good or bad fortune. But although one can easily show the falsity of both of these opinions, still, being obliged to choose, it is better to follow the former, because they are always industrious and diligent, and when they have poor success they double their diligence and industry, being people who think that their loss arrives due to their indiscretion or insufficiency and not due to fortune. So that although they do not achieve what they desire, they at least strive courageously. Also, the one who is industrious no longer needs to wait for the arrival of fortune, because if it comes, he knows how to govern it; whereas the one who is not industrious is constrained not only to wait for fortune but also, when it comes, to wait for it alone to do all things for him. And although the fortuitous things that fortune brings can succeed well (which happens very seldom), besides the fact that this brings no praise to the one fortune favors, it is a dangerous example for the public, since it might cause the public to be less industrious.</p>

46,De la preuve par comparaison d'ecritures,838,"<p>This treatise expresses serious doubts about the forensic examination of handwriting. Its author, Roland Le Vayer de Boutigny, was a lawyer and <em>maître des requêtes</em> (high level judicial officer) at the Parlement of Paris, who also wrote other treatises, plays, and novels. <em>De la preuve par comparaison d’écritures </em>was published in Paris in about 1666 and reedited in 1704. This manuscript is a copy of one of the printed versions, but no one has yet done a comparison to identify which one. It is also possible that this manuscript is a copy of another manuscript, although that seems much less likely. One copyist prepared the body of the text, but someone else added the marginal notes. An inscription in the bound volume indicates that at least one bibliographer believed the marginalia to be in Le Vayer’s own hand, but this has not been verified.</p>
<p>A late 18th- or early 19th-century owner of the manuscript created a literary triptych by having it bound with a copy of the printed book from 1666, and also with L. P. Vallain’s <em>Traité sur la preuve par comparaison d’écritures, pour servir de réponse au Traité de M. Le Vayer </em>. . . (1761), which Vallain published as a response to Le Vayer de Boutigny.</p>

47,Discours et harangue des ambassadeurs du Roy avec ceulx d'Angleterre touchant le pourparler du mariaige d'entre monseigneur le duc d'Anjou et d'Alençon avec la Royne d'Angleterre,838,"<p>This is the story of the princess and the frog, or that of Queen Elizabeth I and her last serious suitor, François, duke of Alençon and Anjou.</p>
<p>In the context of the threat of war with Spain in the 1570s and 1580s, a matrimonial alliance between Queen Elizabeth and a French prince was considered highly desirable on both sides of the Channel. Catherine de Medici was determined to see one of her sons rule England. The first candidate in 1570-71 was her third son Henri, who would later become King Henri III of France, but he called off the match in 1572. Almost immediately, Catherine started a new campaign, offering her youngest son François, duke of Alençon and Anjou (1555-1584), as a prospective suitor for Elizabeth. From 1572 to 1583, this projected alliance, now referred to as the <em>Alençon match</em>, was used as a diplomatic tool to ensure peace between France and England.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was favorable to the match and appears to have been fond of François. She was seen wearing the frog-shaped earrings he sent her, and called him her “little frog” in the letters they exchanged. During François’s second visit in England, Elizabeth even formally announced at court her intention to marry him (22 November 1581), giving him a kiss and a ring on that occasion. Elizabeth herself may have composed the famous poem <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173485"">“On Monsieur’s Departure”</a> when François sailed for the Netherlands on 1 February 1582. Nevertheless, the courtship was definitely broken off a few months later: Elizabeth’s letter from 10 September 1583, in reply to François’s request for support for his war in the Netherlands, terminated the relationship.</p>
<p>There were serious oppositions to the match, especially from the English Parliament and the city of London. At issue was François’s faith, as well as the age difference between the two (Elizabeth was 39 in 1572, and François, 17). Elizabeth’s childbearing ability was also a cause of concern for both sides.</p>
<p>The document presented here was likely drafted by Pierre Clausse, lord of Marchaumont and secretary of state, and Jean Bodin, a jurist and member of the <em>Parlement de Paris</em>, during an embassy to London in the spring of 1581. It appears in a manuscript compilation dated about 1575-1585, written in several contemporary hands. The collection was most probably put together in France, possibly by someone associated with royal circles. It includes different types of documents organized somewhat chronologically: treatises (on substance dualism, heretics, and good government), speeches (to the Queen Mother, the King, the French courts of justice; also pleas and remonstrances), letters (by Queen Elizabeth, and the King of Navarre, a cousin of the French royal family), poems (sonnets and acrostic poems), various decrees from the <em>Parlement de Paris</em>, and more. Letters by Elizabeth I, dated 1585 and addressed to the king of France and the Queen Mother, follow the documents related to the “Alençon match” (see folios 133r-143v). A veiled allusion to the match also appears in the <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography:429#a1821ff1-597e-4752-8772-cfe3a2184869"">Harangue faicte à la Royne mere du Roy à Poictiers par le seigneur de Salevert presidial de ladicte ville le lendemain de son arrivée qui fut le vingt huictiesme novembre 1575</a><em> </em>(fol. 33r), copied in the same volume.</p>

<p>The document presented here is a copy of the ruling of the <em>maître des requêtes </em><em>of the Parlement de Paris</em><em> </em>in favor of Langeac.

<p>The court dossier for the 1564 fishing rights dispute is part of a larger collection of documents related to the seigneurie of Bonnabaud, sold by Anne-Joseph-Gilbert-Allyre de Langeac to Amable-Jacques Soubrany de Bénistant in 1787.

50,"Fur trade contract between François Francoeur and four ""voyageurs"" for transport of goods and purchase of beaver pelts in Michilimackinac and Chicago",838,"<p>This is one of the earliest documents in which the name “Chicago” appears. Prior to the Newberry’s acquisition of the manuscript, someone underlined in pencil the words “au lieu dit Chicagou” (“in the place called Chicago”) half-way down the left side of the page. The library has not removed the marking, for reasons of conservation.</p>
<p>François Francoeur (or Francour) dit Lavallée, of Ville-Marie (now Montreal), was one among hundreds of “voyageurs” who traveled throughout northern North America during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, trading with Indian nations and collecting furs. He married Marie-Madeleine Saint-Jean, who was Onondaga, in 1689.</p>
<p>This contract, drawn up in Ville-Marie in 1692, establishes an agreement regarding the transport of goods and purchase of beaver pelts in Chicago and at Fort Michilimackinac, between Francoeur, represented by his wife, and four “voyageurs,” who agreed to travel by canoe to the Jesuit mission and French army post situated at the mouth of the Chicago River. The document thus testifies to the widening scope of the fur trade in Illinois at the end of the seventeenth century and to the role of Native women in administration of the trade.</p>
<p>Francoeur must have been one of the lucky traders who had a license. Beginning in the 1670s, the French government began issuing annual licenses in order to regulate the fur trade. They were difficult to obtain. Between 1682 and the turn of the century, only 25 official licenses were granted annually. They were so valuable that they circulated like currency and could be exchanged against goods. If an independent “voyageur” was unable to secure a permit, the only other means to participate in the fur trade was to negotiate a subcontract, such as the four “voyageurs” did here with Francoeur, via his wife, who was managing the business in his absence.</p>

52,Inquest regarding land disputes,838,"<p>Here we present a few pages of a document that records oral testimonies of people living in the village of Saint-Bonnet-le-Bourg,<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""" id=""_ftnref2"">[2]</a> in Auvergne, regarding a disputed piece of land claimed by the Fayolle family.</p>
<p>The document is signed by Amable-Jacques de Soubrany (b. 1610), a lawyer, receiver general for taxes in Riom, and <em>conseiller en la sénéchaussée d’Auvergne et présidial de Riom</em>. As a civil officer, Soubrany oversaw the inquest, and heard the testimonies that are recorded in the document.</p>
<p>Amable-Jacques de Soubrany is the patriarch of an important land owning family established in Riom, in Auvergne. A large number of family documents are found in the <a href=""https://www.newberry.org/lauzanne-family-papers"">Lauzanne Family Papers</a>, including birth certificates and marriage contracts, wills, personal letters, quittances, legal dossiers, sale and leasing contracts, etc.</p>
<p>Amable-Jacques married Gilberte de Lobeyrie, lady of Bénistant, in 1636, and the family adopted the name “Soubrany de Bénistant” from then on. Our collection includes <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/search/catch_all_fields_mt%3A%28Lobeyrie%29?f%5B0%5D=-entity_type%3A%22node%22"">three documents related to the Lobeyrie family</a>. </p>
<p>During the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century, the members of the Soubrany de Bénistant were particularly fond of the name “Amable,” which was given both to men and women. Jacques-Amable named one of his sons and one of his daughters Amable. His son Jacques-François married Amable Bournet. Among their children were Amable-Gilberte, Claude-Amable, and Amable-Jacques. This Amable-Jacques had a daughter named Amable, and a son named Jacques-Amable, who in turn had a daughter named Amable-Perrette and a son named Amable-Jacques. If the latter had had children, the “Amable” line might have continued, but he died without issue.</p>
<p>Jacques-Amable’s son Amable is the patriarch of another Soubrany line, known as “Soubrany de Verrières,” from which the famous revolutionary Pierre-Amable de Soubrany de Verrières de Macholles (1752-1795) is issued.</p>

53,Inventaire du mobilier et du matérial d’imprimerie de Jean Chardon,838,"<p>After the death of the Paris printer Jean Chardon in 1682, his widow and eldest son had this inventory drawn up, listing his household goods and the equipment found in his shop on the rue Galande in the parish of Saint Séverin, in the Latin Quarter. The level of detail is invaluable for helping us to understand the nature of the printing business in Paris in the late 17th century. The appraisers, Pierre le Mercier and Clement Gasse, were Parisian printers and booksellers themselves.</p>
<p>The document sheds light on the fact that most printing concerns were also family businesses. Both personnel and material moved from press to press along family lines. As was typical, Chardon’s widow, Marie Denys (Denis) was herself the daughter of a bookseller and binder, Mathurin Denys. Marie took over her husband’s business after his death, under the name “Veuve [widow] Jean Chardon,” and ran it until 1712.</p>
<p>Marie and Jean had three sons, all mentioned in the preliminary matter for the inventory, two of whom also became printers and booksellers: the eldest, Etienne Chardon, active 1683-1695, and one of his younger brothers, Sebastien, active 1711-1719 (the third son was Jean). The document indicates that upon his father’s death Etienne became guardian to his brothers.</p>
<p>A year before his death, their father had purchased four printing presses from the Veuve Charles I Coignard printing business – another business run by a widow. Those four presses were likely among the seven presses listed in the inventory (see folio 3r).</p>

54,Printing agreement by Jacques de Sanlecque and Toussaint du Bray,838,"<p>The life of Toussaint Du Bray (1580?-1637) evidences upward personal and professional mobility. Notaries always recorded his name as “du Bray” or “Dubray,” but later in life he adopted the habit of writing “Du Bray.” His father was a <em>maistre fripier</em> in Paris—a vendor of used, repaired objects. After his father’s death in 1583, the merchant-bookseller Etienne Vallet became the guardian of the toddler Toussaint and his younger sister Girarde. In 1600 Girarde married Jacques de Sanlecque, a Paris printer, who then became Toussaint’s guardian for a few years before he reached his majority at age 25.  Toussaint opened his own bookshop at about the time of his sister’s marriage, located first in the Palais de Justice and then later in the Latin Quarter on the rue Saint-Jacques. Toussaint married Marie Sanlecque, the daughter of a bourgeois merchant who was most likely a relative of his brother-in-law Jacques. Additionally, Antoine Du Breuil, a well-established bookseller, seems to have taken Du Bray under his wing and guided him during his early years in the profession. They collaborated on producing several editions, which launched Du Bray’s career as an editor. Beginning in 1604, Du Bray published approximately ten titles per year, specializing in new literature. From then until his death in 1637 he collaborated with numerous printers, engravers, and editors, including his brother-in-law—with whom he signed this document in 1614, attesting that they had received manuscripts from the widow of François Beccaria de Pavie, baron de Fourquevaux (who had died in 1611), with the intention of publishing the texts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>François de Pavie was a novelist and poet, many of whose works have been lost. Du Bray and Sanlecque do not appear to have published any of the manuscripts they purchased from his widow, although the first title mentioned in the notarial record, <em>Les Vies de plusieurs grands capitaines français</em>, was printed in 1643 by Du Bray’s son, Jean.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The document cites texts recounting voyages to Jerusalem and to England, which do not appear to have survived. What did survive is Fourquevaux’s account of his journey to Poland in 1585, which remained in manuscript until 1933, when it saw print as <em>La Pologne vue par deux voyageurs français du XVIe siècle</em> (along with a narrative by Jacques Esprinchard, sieur du Plon, from 1597).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <em>Espadon satyrique</em>, a collection of satirical poetry first printed in Lyon in 1619, has sometimes been attributed to Fourquevaux, on the assumption that he was using the pseudonym of Esternod, but it appears that the author was Claude d’Esternod (1590-1640).</p>

59,Partage de l'héritage de François de L'Estang,838,"<p>This document details the division of the assets held by François de L’Estang, <em>seigneur</em> of Bouis in Auvergne, upon his death. His widow Louise d’Harzillemont retired to a property owned by the Harzillemont family in Picardy and decided to sell to her brother-in-law Philippe de L’Etang part of her share of the common inheritance.</p>
<p>François de L’Estang and his brothers Philippe and Gilbert appear to have been cousins of Pierre de Lauzanne (1590-1642), <em>seigneur</em> of Bouis, Puy-Malsignat and de L’Estang. Pierre and his wife Louise d’Haultefaye had seven sons, including Claude (1626-1692), the patriarch of a Lauzanne family branch established in Auvergne in the area of Puy-Malsignat. Claude and Louise’s third son Sébastien (1627-1695) left Auvergne for Brittany, where he acted as captain in the Mazarin regiment and founded the Brittany branch of the Lauzanne family. The sixth son of Pierre and Louise, Philibert (1632-1684), <em>seigneur</em> of Saigne Vieille and Rochegude, viscount of Vaurousset, became the patriarch of another Lauzanne family branch in Auvergne and Limousin. He married Anne d’Anglars de Rochegude in 1676, granddaughter to <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography:487#26fff7da-f2ac-4afd-bf83-c5b31f5c6563"">Annet d’Anglars and Anne de Rochegude, whose marriage contract can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The document reproduced here is part of <a href=""https://www.newberry.org/lauzanne-family-papers"">The Lauzanne Family Papers</a>, an archive of documents of the Lauzanne family and other allied families established in Auvergne held at the Newberry Library. Numerous documents pertain to Pierre, his sons, and their progeny, such as a confirmation of the nobility of the Lauzanne family obtained by Sébastien in 1667, and leasing agreements for the <em>seigneurie</em> of Saigne Vieille signed by Philibert and his wife Anne.</p>
<p>There are about 500 documents directly related to the Lauzanne family in this archive spanning the 16<sup>th</sup> to the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The earliest Lauzanne document, dated 2 October 1535, confirms the rights of Jacques de Lauzanne (b. 1505) to the <em>seigneurie</em> of Sermur, while the most recent is a letter dated 1965. Important figures of the Lauzanne family include François-Guillaume de Lauzanne (1674-1733), whose documents pertain mostly to the administration of his <em>seigneuries</em> of Puy-Malsignat and la Maisonneuve, and a different Pierre de Lauzanne (1730-1792), who was <em>brigadier</em> and <em>maître des eaux et forêts d’Auvergne</em>. Many letters sent to him still bear original red seals. Amable-Joseph-Philippe de Lauzanne, known as Frédéric (1807-1873), plays a role in many of the family documents, partly due to an inheritance received from his uncle Amable-Jacques de Soubrany de Bénistant in 1842, his involvement in several other inheritance legal cases, and the extent of his assets.</p>
<p>The earliest documents in the entire collection are related to the Langeac family, including several documents on vellum from the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> century. They are in the collection due to the alliance of Françoise de Vichy to François de Lauzanne in 1584. Françoise was the daughter of Françoise de Langeac and François de Vichy, and heir to the <em>seigneurie</em> of the Puy-Malsignat. <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/search/catch_all_fields_mt%3A%28Langeac%29?f%5b0%5d=-entity_type%3A%22node%22&sort=mods_originInfo_qualifier_approximate_dateIssued_s%20asc"">Six Langeac family documents</a> are found in our digital collection.</p>

60,Lancelot du lac,838,"<p>The “Vulgate” Lancelot cycle, also called the Lancelot-Grail cycle, is a series of five interrelated Old French prose texts dealing with King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the quest for the Grail, and the adventures of Lancelot. Three of the works tell of Lancelot’s adventures and his love for Guinevere (<em>Lancelot en prose</em>, <em>La queste del saint Graal</em>, and <em>La mort le roi Artu</em>), while the other two are “pre-histories” (<em>Estoire del saint Graal</em> and <em>Le roman de Merlin en prose</em>) recounting the story of Arthur’s kingdom before Lancelot’s birth, and the early history of the Grail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This manuscript held by the Newberry Library contains only the <em>Lancelot du Lac</em>, which is a portion of the <em>Lancelot en prose </em>or the “Lancelot proper” that constitutes the third and largest section of the Lancelot-Grail cycle. Lancelot’s legendary love for Guinevere and his heroic exploits with the other Knights of the Round Table form the focus of the <em>Lancelot du Lac.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The texts of the Lancelot-Grail cycle were originally composed in the first third of the 13<sup>th</sup> century. Audiences eager for tales of courtly love and chivalric adventure enthusiastically read and commissioned copies of the Lancelot-Grail cycle, making it one of the most popular vernacular texts of the later Middle Ages. Over 150 manuscripts containing all or some of the cycle survive today, most dating from the 13<sup>th</sup> through the 15<sup>th</sup> century. Some manuscript copies commissioned for royal and aristocratic owners include lavish illustrations, while many other copies contain few or no images at all and were made for patrons from a wider range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Other Arthurian texts also circulated widely among the same audiences; the Getty Museum’s <em>Roman de Tristan </em>(MS Ludwig XV 5) is an example of a luxury romance manuscript with an elaborate pictorial program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This particular manuscript of 354 folios was copied around the year 1300 and contains three single-column miniatures, found on folsios 1r, 200r, and 292r. The image on the opening folio is badly worn from use, but the figures of two kings with their sisters are still discernible. Fol. 200r depicts Galaad in full armor mounted on his horse, and fol. 292r illustrates a scene in which a boat steered by the sister of Méléagant (the villain who abducts Guinevere) approaches Lancelot imprisoned in a tower. Inscriptions on the first page indicate that this manuscript once belonged to the library of Claude d’Urfé (1501-1558), an ambassador who served under Kings François I (ruled 1515-1547) and Henri II (ruled 1547-1559). Claude d’Urfé’s ownership of the <em>Lancelot du Lac </em>in the 16<sup>th</sup> century suggests that popular enthusiasm for Arthurian stories continued well into the Renaissance. </p>

64,"Lectures on the Charter of the Forests, reissued by Henry III in 1225",838,"<p>This manuscript contains sixteen lectures on law -- specifically, on the topic of the Charter of the Forests, a document of major economic, political, and environmental concern in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.</p>
<p>Following the Norman invasion of England in the 11<sup>th</sup> century, the Normans and early Plantagenets claimed forests in England as personal hunting grounds. Areas designated as hunting preserves already existed, but the conquerors expanded them and also protected their claims through greater legal measures. During the reign of King John (1188-1199), friction between some barons (particularly in the north) and the Crown motivated the barons to formulate complaints about the forests as specific demands for reform. The negotiations resulted in the “Charter of the Forests,” brought forth in 1217 along with the reissued <a href=""http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta"">Magna Carta</a>, a document that established forest courts and the appointment of officers.</p>
<p>Now a Lord Warden was designated to oversee each forest, to prevent abuses of the area. Administrators working under him also were charged with maintaining the welfare of the forests and the animals. Additional legal changes enacted by the Charter included forgiving individuals who had committed forest offenses in the past and promising the removal of certain lands from the royal forests. By bringing the royal forests under the rule of law the Charter ensured that those lands would no longer be subject exclusively to the will of the king or the aristocracy; commoners now gained legal rights and privileges to work the land (which included heaths as well as wooded areas) in certain ways.</p>
<p>In 1225 King Henry III, sorely in need of revenue due to a recent civil war, reissued the Charter and the Magna Carta. This was a way of bargaining with his subjects – extracting taxes from them while confirming these legal documents. The versions of 1225 are the ones still on the Statute Book in the United Kingdom today.</p>

65,Legal documents concerning the inventory of the estate of Jean Nicollet,838,"<p>This collection of legal documents sheds light on the family and property of the legendary French interpreter and trader Jean Nicollet (Nicolet), who led an adventuresome life in New France during the early years of the colony, when Samuel de Champlain was exploring the Saint Lawrence River valley and establishing fur trading posts throughout the region. (<a href=""/islandora/object/paleography:384"">Click here</a> for one of Champlain’s maps.)</p>
<p>Beginning in 1619 Nicollet lived for a brief time among the Kichesipirini Alonquins on Allumette Island (in the Ottawa River, near present-day Pembroke, Ontario). Then he spent nine years with the Nipissing (closer to Lake Huron), where he established a store. Following the English capture of Quebec City in 1629, he took refuge among the Huron (Wendat). A few years later, he traveled to the upper Great Lakes region, to what is today’s state of Wisconsin, a voyage that brought him to the realization that China and the Pacific must lie even further west than previously believed.</p>
<p>Nicollet married twice: first, a Nipissing woman with whom he had a daughter, Euphrosine, also known as Madeleine. He brought his daughter, after her mother died, to be raised in Quebec City. He then settled in Trois-Rivières as a clerk and interpreter for the <em>Compagnie des Cent-Associés</em> (or <em>Compagnie de la Nouvelle-France</em>), where he married a godchild of Champlain, Marguerite Couillard, with whom he had two children, a son who did not survive and a daughter who did. Via this connection with an important colonial family, he came into co-ownership, with his brother-in-law Olivier Letardif (or Le Tardif), of some land at the outskirts of Quebec City. Letardif was one of the witnesses to the 1638 ceremony narrated in another document included in this website, which confirmed land grants that had been made along the Saint Lawrence to an association of French investors (see the <a href=""/islandora/object/paleography:443""><em>Investiture de l'Ile d'Orléans</em></a> manuscript).</p>
<p>Nicollet drowned in 1642 when strong winds overturned his boat in the Saint Lawrence, just outside Quebec. The document transcribed here reveals that his second daughter was only eight months old when he died. Nicollet’s brother, Pierre, a sailor, was designated as the child’s guardian on 26 November 1642, and then an inventory and appraisal of Nicollet’s property was drawn up the following day. His widow, Marguerite; her father, Guillaume Couillard; and various other witnesses were present for the drafting of the inventory. Guillaume Couillard and Pierre Nicollet both made marks instead of signatures, because they did not know how to sign. Marguerite, however, knew how to write her name.</p>
<p>The documents in the Newberry’s Nicollet dossier include the inventory itself (a list of 48 items of clothing, furniture, and housewares with their estimated value); a list of additional items missing from the initial inventory; and a list of land titles and important family papers.</p>

66,Legal notebook,838,"<p>The document presented here is from a legal miscellany likely compiled by a law student in the early 17th century. In the early modern period French was the language of common law in England, and was used in the Inns of Court and the Inns of Chancery. A beginner Inns of Court lawyer would be allowed to argue in English, but an advanced one would be expected to plead in French.</p>
<p>This particular miscellany is on the topic of real property. It discusses issues related to land and property ownership, and the division of estates among heirs. Rules and laws are first described, followed by a series of precedent legal cases (see fol. 8v).</p>
<p>Th miscellany could have been prepared for a land owning member of the nobility, who needed to be knowledgeable about English common law to administer his (or possibly her) estates or establish his status. The use of French is notable, since this type of instruction was more frequently written in English: see for example John Kitchin’s <em>Jurisdictions or the Lawful Authority of Courts Leet, Courts Baron, Court of Marshallseys, Court of Pypowder, and Ancient Demesne, together with the most necessary learnings of tenure and all their incidents […]</em> (1580).</p>
<p>This manuscript’s handwriting was originally attributed to the English statesman Sir Francis Bacon. However, Seymour de Ricci, who conducted a census of manuscripts in the United States and Canada, found no evidence to support that attribution. We hope users of this site will be able to help identify the scribe and the text.</p>

68,Recueil des Serées,838,"<p>This text on the dangers of drinking appears in a commonplace book compiled for Louis de Marillac, a member of the French aristocracy, in the late 16th century.</p>
<p>It has sometimes been thought that the original owner was his more illustrious younger brother, Jean-Louis de Marillac, the Count of Beaumont-le-Roger (also sometimes known as just ""Louis""), who was destined to lose his head in 1632 after being implicated in a plot to overthrow Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of King Louis XIII. Because it's such a great story, we'll tell it here:</p>
<p>To ensure French dominance during the Thirty Years’ War that engulfed central Europe between 1618 and 1648, Richelieu rejected the Franco-Spanish alliance and supported instead a coalition of Protestant powers. Louis XIII stood by his minister, while others – including Louis de Marillac, Marshall of France, and his half-brother Michel, Keeper of the Seals – sided with the Queen Mother, Marie de Medici, in favor of pro-Spanish Catholic zealots. On Richelieu’s orders, Louis was arrested in Savoy in 1632, where he was commander of the French army, on trumped-up charges of misappropriation of funds. A special commission of hand-picked judges, who met in one of Richelieu’s palaces, condemned Louis to death by a narrow vote of thirteen to ten, and he was decapitated in Paris.</p>
<p>However, it is much more likely that the book first belonged to the older Louis de Marillac, who, shortly before his death in 1604, presented it to Louise de Marillac (later to become Saint Louise de Marillac). She was a child at the time. Louis served as guardian to Louise, and she probably was his natural daughter. The binding on the book appears to date from around 1600 and is stamped with the name ""Loyse de Marilliac."" It's not impossible that she could have been the daughter of Jean-Louis, who entrusted her to the guardianship of his older brother, but that seems much less likely, given that she was 40 years old when Jean-Louis died in 1632, and the binding clearly dates from several decades earlier. Louise later co-founded with Vincent de Paul the religious order of the Daughters of Charity, and she, as well as Vincent de Paul, has been canonized as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The content of the Marillac manuscript is incredibly recursive – a lesson in the art of borrowing and abridging. The manuscript is a commonplace book, a compilation of material quoted and paraphrased from other sources. The section we have reproduced is a compilation of passages taken from various chapters of a popular commonplace book first printed in Paris in 1584, Guillaume Bouchet’s <em>Les Ser</em><em>é</em><em>es</em>. Bouchet’s volume consists of thirty-six after-dinner dialogues (“soirées,” evening gatherings) which he created by drawing on other commonplace books. André Janier has now published an extensive study of Bouchet and the tradition of these books in France in the later 16th and early 17th century.</p>
<p>Phrases in the Marillac version of <em>Les Ser</em><em>é</em><em>es</em> are taken from these sections of Bouchet’s book: the author's introduction (“Discours de l’autheur sur son livre des Serées”); the first ""serée,"" on the subject of wine; the second ""serée,"" on water; the third ""serée,"" on women and girls; the fifth ""serée,"" on newlyweds; the sixth ""serée,"" on fish; and the seventh, on dogs.</p>

72,"Letter: Residence de la Conception-aux-Hurons, to M. le curé de St. Martin, à Beauvais [France], 1639 May 25",838,"<p>Father Simon Le Moyne wrote this autograph letter at La Conception-aux-Hurons, which was then a newly-founded Jesuit mission in the Wendat (Huron) village of Ossossané. Today, the historic site of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons or Sainte-Marie-au-pays-des-Hurons, in Ontario, commemorates the mission.</p>
<p>By 1639 the Wendat (a confederacy of five Iroquoian-speaking nations) had become important suppliers of furs to the French, but their numbers were declining rapidly, due to epidemics. The mission at Ossossané would last only ten years. A report by Father Paul Ragueneau, dated March 1, 1649, indicates that the French presence in the settlement had grown in just a decade to more than 60 men, including priests, laymen, servants, and soldiers. But only a couple of weeks later, the Haudenosaunee (commonly referred to as the Iroquois or Six Nations) would capture two Jesuits, Jean de Brebeuf and Gabriel Lalemant, near Sainte-Marie, and kill them. By May, in the wake of continuing violence, and seeing that fifteen Wendat villages had already been destroyed, the Frenchmen and the Wendat at Sainte-Marie burned their settlement and fled to St. Joseph Island (now Christian Island), where they tried to establish a new Sainte-Marie. But after a terrible winter of starvation and constant attack, the Frenchmen and those Wendat who had become Christians retreated to Quebec, in summer 1650. Father Le Moyne subsequently became a negotiator between the French and the Haudenosaunee.</p>
<p>When Le Moyne wrote this letter though, he had only just arrived in New France. He addressed the letter, sharing news about the founding of the mission, to his cousin Charles Maine, a parish priest at the church of St. Martin in Le Moyne's home town of Beauvais, France.</p>

","<p>The Peace and Love of the great Jesus.</p>
<p>Sir and Dearest Cousin,</p>
<p>Marvelous! That this scrap of paper should reach you after shooting so many rapids and enduring so many dangers. Is it not because my spirit had paved the way for it more than a thousand times, without [making] the journey? Oh, if you could see me here in this end of the world, blessing and singing over the holy water, and saying Holy Mass for the parishioners of our district; for, after eight or nine months, we count in this barbaric region two or three churches or assemblies of neophytes. But what consolation it is to a sympathetic heart, to see here every day in our cabins how our good Jesus is adored by a people to whom he is still only half known. I say every day, for, although they do not come to hear Mass, except on solemn feasts and Sundays, they still come to our bark chapel every morning, and often every evening, to say their prayers. Do you know how? We have translated into their language the Sign of the Cross, an appropriate Act of Contrition, of twelve or thirteen lines; the Pater; the Ave; and other prayers of that sort, which these faithful neophytes -- most of them older men -- recite after me, on all sides, with deep feeling. From the beginning God must indeed have enhanced their defects of understanding, since they themselves so discreetly feign not to notice our errors in pronouncing their language. Until you have the satisfaction of reading our Relation of this year, which will be published, I believe, in Paris, I am addressing to my Jesuit brother something to whet rather than to assuage your curiosity. I hope that my mother will cause you to see it, I recall her and myself to your holy sacrifices and prayers; for I am [crossed out: to you], cordially, in this other world, the same as always, which is to say,</p>
<p>Sir and dearest cousin,</p>
<p>Very dear and obliged servant and cousin,</p>
<p>Simon Le Moyne, of the Society of Jesus</p>

<p>These two speeches appear in a collection of manuscript documents of many different types, but all dating from about 1575 to 1585, copied in contemporary hands, and probably compiled in France by someone associated with royal circles. (On folio 34v we see the first paragraph of the next text in the compilation: <em>Remonstrances treshumbles de la ville de Paris au Roy son souverain seigneur faicte au mois de decembre 1579</em>.)</p>
<p>The organization of the compilation is somewhat chronological: treatises (on substance dualism, heretics, and good government), speeches (to the Queen Mother, the King, the Paris Parlement; pleas and remonstrances), letters (by Queen Elizabeth I of England; by Henri, King of Navarre, cousin to the French royal family), poems (sonnets and acrostic poems), various decrees from the Parlement, and so on.</p>
<p>The French Civil Wars were raging at the time these speeches were made -- specifically, the fifth war, sparked by the death of King Charles IX (May 30, 1574). Next in line for the throne was Charles’s brother Henri, who was in Poland at the time because he had been crowned king of Poland the year before. During the first months of Henri III’s reign, before he returned to France, his younger brother, François, duke of Anjou, plotted to claim the crown for himself, and Calvinist factions in France benefited from the lapse in government to plunder the country. Henri, upon his return, forced François to flee the court. So on September 15, 1575, François headed south and joined forces with the prince of Condé and other Protestant rebels in southern France. Their troops pillaged villages and towns and even threatened the city of Poitiers. On October 31, Henri III wrote to Guy de Daillon, count of Lude, lieutenant general of Poitou, to press him to secure Poitiers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Queen Mother, Catherine de Medici, traveled to southern France to negotiate with her son François. They reached a peace agreement on November 22, but insecurity and severe tensions remained. Catherine then spent a whole month in Poitiers, beginning on November 27, to appease the fears of its inhabitants and regain control over the region for the Catholic Crown.</p>
<p>Our document contains a veiled allusion to a proposed marriage between Queen Elizabeth I and François, duke of Alençon and Anjou(folio 33r). During the years 1572-1583 the English and French both used this proposed match as a diplomatic tool to maintain good relations. Catherine wrote to Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's secretary, from Poitiers in early December 1575, and had also discussed the match with her son while in southern France, in an attempt to divert him from creating more trouble and to lure him on a journey to England. See the <a href=""/islandora/object/paleography:430"">“Alençon match.”</a></p>
<p>The two speeches reproduced here were delivered by Pierre Rat, <em>seigneur</em> of Salvert (1539-1593), president of the <em>présidial</em> (royal court of appeal) of Poitiers at the time of the Queen Mother’s visit.

75,"Confirmation of the donations made by Louis, Duke of Orléans, and his mother to the convent of Sainte-Croix in Chauny",838,"<p>A son honoring the memory of his illustrious parents, a famed poet, and a beloved patroness of the arts – these are the actors behind the document presented here.</p>
<p>The story begins in 1353: King John II of France exchanged some land with one of his four brothers, Philip, for whom the Duchy of Orléans had recently been created: John swaps the County of Beaumont-sur-Oise for that of Beaumont-le-Roger in Normandy. From then on, Beaumont-sur-Oise becomes part of the appanage of the dukes of Orléans.</p>
<p>Years later, in the aftermath of the Battle of Agincourt (1415), the poet and duke Charles d’Orléans sells Chauny, a seignory in Beaumont-sur-Oise, to pay for his ransom. Once liberated, Charles buys back Chauny in 1450 and makes his wife, Maria of Cleves, lady of Chauny.</p>
<p>Upon her husband's death in 1465, Maria makes Chauny her home. She has a residence built there for her use during her lifetime, called “la maison d’Orléans,” which she wishes to be given to the Convent of Sainte-Croix upon her death. She signs a donation to this effect on 26 July 1485. In October of the same year, her son Louis gives letters patent at Blois to transfer the Convent of Sainte-Croix, then situated in nearby Condren, to Chauny. The document presented here confirms the two preceding deeds, and also establishes a new donation for the construction of another building for the convent.</p>
<p>Maria dies in 1487, and in 1492, Louis honors his parents' memory by fulfilling his mother's wishes and becoming a patron to a small community of monks residing in a little-known part of the estate of the dukes of Orléans.</p>
<p>Louis would later rule France from 1498 to 1515 as King Louis XII, succeeding his cousin Charles VIII. Louis owed his right to the crown to his ancestor King Philip VI of Valois, who had made his fifth son Philip the first Duke of Orléans.</p>

76,Contrat du mariage d'Annet d'Anglars et d'Anne de Rochegude,838,"<p>Marriage, in medieval and <em>Ancien Régime</em> France, was serious business. Before a man and woman married, they would have a notary draw up a marriage contract, not only to set the details of the dowry, but also to protect the rights of the bride and determine her share of her family’s patrimony. As such, the marriage contract was an act of succession.</p>
<p>The marriage contract was usually drawn up at the bride’s residence, in the presence of members of both families, who would sign the official legal document, or <em>minute</em>. In the following days or weeks, the signatories would receive a copy of the marriage contract, signed only by the notary, called <em>expédition</em>. While the <em>minute</em> was the official document, kept by the notary, the <em>expédition</em> was usually preserved by families with other important papers, and could be used in litigations. As the <em>expédition</em> represented the essence of the marriage contract, it was generally a solemn document, often written on a large piece of parchment, a noble and expensive material, in a beautiful and ornate handwriting.</p>
<p>The document reproduced here is not an <em>expédition</em>, but simply a copy of the marriage contract, made about twenty-five years after the signing of the <em>minute</em>. Before he got married, Annet d’Anglars gave land to his mother Avoise the Tabou in the <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography%3A488#22a9ce7a-82f2-4f58-a13d-a6f0fa6bf124"">contract presented here</a>.</p>
<p>When Anne de Rochegude married Annet d’Anglars, she brought to her new family the <em>seigneurie</em> of Rochegude, so Anne and Annet’s children adopted the name <em>Anglars de Rochegude</em>. Their great-grand-daughter Anne married Philibert de Lauzanne in 1676, at which point the <em>seigneurie</em> became part of the Lauzanne apanage. Philibert de Lauzanne, sixth son of Pierre de Lauzanne and Louise d’Haultefaye, is the patriarch of an important branch of the Lauzanne family, which allied, among others, with the Soubrany de Bénistant and the Frétat de Chirac. This marriage contract was likely included in the <em>Lauzanne Family Papers </em>because of its connection to the <em>seigneurie </em>de Rochegude. For an overview of the collection, see the <a href=""http://newberry.org/lauzanne-family-papers""><em>Lauzanne Family Papers</em></a>.</p>
<p>For examples of <em>expéditions</em> of marriage contracts from the Lauzanne Family Papers, see <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography%3A484#52b4dfe1-d5f3-487c-9d00-866b691aed6b""><em>Expédition du contrat du mariage de Jean de Jardon et de Françoise de Rochefort</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography%3A476#caf91ed7-a788-410b-8093-f3d92c85a452""><em>Epédition du contrat de mariage de Guillaume Lobeyrie et d’Anthonie Anglade</em></a><em>,</em> and <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography%3A483#dfbb667f-fb18-4d1a-9775-0716c3244fd3""><em>Expédition du contrat du mariage de Catherine Lobeyrie et Jean Favy</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>This <em>expédition</em> is unusual in the sense that it was not drawn up shortly after the <em>minute</em> was signed, but rather, about thirity years later, when a <em>confession</em> was completed. The <em>confession</em> was a solemn declaration by the husband confirming that he had received the dowry in full, and in certain cases, sums of money or real property supplementing the dowry.</p>
<p>This document forms part of a large archive of personal documents of allied noble families established in Auvergne, the <em>Lauzanne Family Papers</em>. It was likely added to the collection as a testimony of the ownership of the <em>seigneurie </em>of Saint-Martial by the Rochefort family, who would later marry into the Langeac family, and bring the <em>seigneurie</em> to them. Gilbert de Rochefort, <em>seigneur</em> of Saint-Martial, had a son, Gaspard, and a daughter, Françoise, who married Jean de Jardon. Gaspard inherited the <em>seigneurie</em> of Saint-Martial from his father, and passed it down to his daughter Anne, who married Gilbert-Allyre de Langeac in 1525. The Langeac then became <em>seigneurs de Saint-Martial</em>. For an overview of the collection, see the <a href=""http://newberry.org/lauzanne-family-papers""><em>Lauzanne Family Papers</em></a>.</p>

80,Double contrat de mariage entre les familles Berugnot et Baptauld,838,"<p>Marriage, in medieval and <em>Ancien Régime</em> France, was serious business. Before a man and woman married, they would have a notary draw up a marriage contract, not only to set the details of the dowry, but also to protect the rights of the bride and determine her share of her family’s patrimony. As such, the marriage contract was an act of succession.</p>
<p>The marriage contract was usually drawn up at the bride’s residence, in the presence of members of both families, who would sign the official legal document, or <em>minute</em>. In the following days or weeks, the signatories would receive a copy of the marriage contract, signed only by the notary, called <em>expédition</em>. While the <em>minute</em> was the official document, kept by the notary, the <em>expédition</em> was usually preserved by families with other important papers, and could be used in litigations. As the <em>expédition</em> represented the essence of the marriage contract, it was generally a solemn document, often written on a large piece of parchment, a noble and expensive material, in a beautiful and ornate handwriting.</p>
<p>The marriage contract presented here appears to be an unsigned contemporary copy made on paper for the family of Jeanne Berugnot. It is likely a copy of the <em>expédition</em>, made for safe-keeping. The document is fairly long and complex, because it involved two marriages between members of two families: Philippe Berugnot marries Nicole Baptauld, and his sister Jehanne marries Nicole’s brother Jehan. Both families lived in Meursault, and were wine growers.</p>

82,Memoranda about Charles d'Orléans's rights as Count of Blois,838,"<p>Charles d’Orléans (1394-1465) famously wrote hundreds of love poems during the 25 years he spent in captivity in England, after being taken prisoner at the Battle of Agincourt (1415). Charles himself did not write the document presented here; rather, it was written by one of his deputies in charge of administering his properties and lands during his captivity (1415-1440). Charles was not only Duke of Orléans, but also Duke of Valois, Count of Beaumont-sur-Oise, Count of Blois, and Lord of Coucy.</p>
<p>In 1434 a disagreement arose between Charles’s administration and that of Charles VII, King of France, regarding tax collection in the County of Blois. In April of that year, two emissaries of the king traveled to Selles-sur-Cher, in the diocese of Bourges, to collect <em>amortissement, </em>a tax owed to the Crown when non-noble people, including members of the clergy, were given a special right to hold or inherit property. This tax created issues in cases where the territory subject to the tax was under the jurisdiction of someone other than the king, as in this particular case: Saint-Aignan, Selles, Valançay, and other places mentioned in the document, while located in the diocese of Bourges, were also part of the County of Blois. The document lists Charles’s <em>droits seigneuriaux</em>, his rights in the County of Blois, even though he is in captivity in England. It refutes the king’s right to <em>amortissement</em> and argues for a postponement of the tax collection until the duke's return.</p>
<p>Louis, the son of Charles d’Orléans, would continue the Orléans lineage and rule France from 1498 to 1515 as King Louis XII. He succeeded his cousin Charles VIII, who had died without a closer heir. <a href=""/islandora/object/paleography:435"">In a document held at the Huntington Library</a>, Louis of Orléans makes arrangements for the construction of a convent in Chauny, in honor of his celebrated father and mother Maria of Cleves.</p>
<p>The Baron de Jourvansault may have owned the memorandum about the rights of Charles d'Orléans in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Jourvansault’s collection consisted of a staggering 80,000 documents related to the history of France, including around 2,500 documents issued by the Blois <em>Chambre des comptes</em> and other administrative instances of the house of Orléans. Number 132bis in the catalog published by the Parisian bookseller and art dealer Joseph Léon Techener in 1838, appears to describe our document: “Instruction sur ce que les conseillers du duc d’Orléans ont à remontrer aux gens du roi à l’occasion d’un impôt qu’ils voulaient prélever au mépris des droits du duc d’Orléans comme comte de Blois- sans date, vers 1434.” The Jourvansault collection was sold by Techener in 1838, and dispersed in European and North American collections.</p>

90,Pompe funebre de Mr le cardinal de Richelieu,838,"<p>We don’t know who authored this satirical obituary poem about Cardinal Richelieu; we hope a user of this website will be able to tell us more about it.</p>
<p>Richelieu (Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu) was a Catholic priest who eventually became King Louis XIII’s chief minister, and a cardinal. Among many notable actions, Richelieu founded the Académie Française, the forty-member scholarly society that continues to update its famed dictionary and monitor use of the French language to this day. The Cardinal also established the Company of New France (<em>Compagnie des Cent-Associés</em>) and invested Samuel de Champlain with the authority to develop the French colony in Northeastern North America. Richelieu carried out a policy of repression of Protestantism in France, and also strove to reduce the influence of the Habsburgs in Europe, inciting a war between France and Spain that continued even after his death. He was autocratic and intransigent and therefore not universally beloved. Upon his death, Pope Urban VIII is supposed to have said: “If there is a God, Cardinal Richelieu will have much to answer for. If not, he has done very well.”</p>
<p>The Newberry Library purchased the Saint-Sulpice Collection, in which this poem is found, in 2003. The religious order of Saint-Sulpice assembled and bound this collection of 2,566 biographical pamphlets in Paris at the beginning of the 19th century. The Sulpicians do parish work, but their main arena of activity has always been education. They collected the pamphlets to serve as educational models, especially for rhetorical writing. Funeral sermons, orations, commemorative verses, and discourses dating from the 16th through the 18th century are included. While most of the pamphlets are printed, the Sulpicians also bound in a few manuscript documents. The majority of the pamphlets are in French, but the collection includes numerous Latin publications as well, and some first editions of short works by well-known writers such as Budé, Molière, and Pascal. The Sulpicians organized the collection alphabetically according to the name of the person described in the individual pamphlet, and then bound them in two series of volumes, to accommodate larger and smaller formats. The Newberry Library has cataloged all of the items in the collection separately, but conserves them in the original volumes, as prepared in Paris in the early 19th century.</p>

The famed Marshall of France, Gilbert de La Fayette, was Louis de La Fayette’s grandfather. Delphine de Bonnabaud’s son, Martin de Chauvigny de Blot, sold the <em>seigneurie</em> of Bonnabaud to Antoine de Langeac in 1465 (a 1478 copy of this sale deed is also found in the court dossier).</p>
<p>The dossier for the 1564 fishing rights dispute is part of a larger collection of documents related to the seigneurie of Bonnabaud, sold by Anne-Joseph-Gilbert-Allyre de Langeac to Amable-Jacques Soubrany de Bénistant in 1787. A large quantity of documents were assembled at the time, including copies of the sale deed, as well as descriptions of the property, lists of tenants, yearly earnings, previous legal disputes, and so forth.</p>

92,Letters patent by King Henry III authorizing Pietro Angèli da Barga to hold ecclesiastical benefices in France,838,"<p>After the Italian humanist Pietro Angèli da Barga presented his epic poem, the <em>Syrias</em>, to King Henry III of France, <a href=""http://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/content/french-institutions"">the king's chancery</a> issued this royal privilege granting to Angèli the titles of royal historian and poet, and permission to hold lands in France. The document was issued in October of 1582, and a copy was notarized on 8 February 1583. Both are reproduced here. The original privilege has the signatures of both Henry and Nicolas de Neufville, his secretary of state, and you can see the place on the document where a red seal (now gone) was affixed.</p>
<p>Angèli had been preceptor to Henry when the king was a boy, and had collaborated with French agents in Italy to secure French manuscripts for Henry’s father, King Francis I. The <em>Syrias</em> narrates the first Crusade, a theme appropriate for dedication to a king, which Torquato Tasso had also recently explored in his <em>Gerusalemme liberata </em>(1575).</p>
<p>Angèli corresponded with the French philologist Denis Lambin, the Lyons printer Antoine Gryphe, and the German poet Paul Schede, among other notables. Letters from these three, addressed to Angèli, as well as about seventy-five volumes from Angèli’s personal library, are found in the Barga Collection, which the Newberry Library purchased in 1968.</p>

93,Ordinance by which King Charles VI of France prohibits assistance to his disinherited son Charles in the aftermath of the assassination of John the Fearless,838,"<p>Montereau Bridge, 10 September 1419: John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, is assassinated by men-at-arms of Charles, Dauphin of France.</p>
<p>Following the assassination, King Charles VI of France issues a royal ordinance to withdraw the Dauphin's rights to the crown of France, and prohibits the people of Paris from offering any assistance to his son. The document charges the Dauphin with crimes of treason, portraying him as a warmonger and deceitful villain who premeditated the murder of his own cousin and proclaimed himself regent of the Kingdom of France. John the Fearless, in contrast, features as the innocent victim of an assassination plot. The ordinance lauds him as a hero for his peacemaking negotiations with England, which would soon lead to a marriage between King Charles VI’s daughter, Catherine of Valois, and King Henry V of England in June 1420.</p>
<p>The events of Montereau-Fault-Yonne took place in a time of high trouble for France. Henry V of England had recently crushed the French royal army at the Battle of Agincourt (1415). The Kingdom was also shaken by power struggles during Charles VI’s bouts of insanity, frequent from the 1390s onwards. With the crown virtually hollow, the Armagnacs, supporters of the house of Orléans, and the Burgundians of John the Fearless ravaged the countryside. In 1407, Louis d’Orléans was killed at John's order. The assassination of John himself in 1419 came as payback, and an attempt to prevent an alliance between Charles and John that would have disadvantaged the Armagnacs. John the Fearless apparently had his own agenda, and had agreed to a meeting at Montereau with the intent to control the Dauphin more closely. Throughout the inquest following the assassination, the future Charles VII denied any involvement.</p>
<p>The Dauphin went on to claim the title of King of France at his father’s death (1422), but Henry VI actually reigned as King of France and England per the Treaty of Troyes (1420). Charles was  finally crowned King Charles VII at Reims Cathedral in 1429, after the intervention of Joan of Arc and successful campaigns to regain control of his kingdom from the English. Another document related to King Charles VII is the<a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography:434#d0f4c040-7004-4a77-821f-9bbe8256514c""> <em>treasury account for Languedoc</em></a>.</p>
<p>There is a copying error in the document presented here. The royal ordinance was dated 17 January 1419 [1420], rather than 27 January. This copy is found in a collection of documents chiefly pertaining to relations between France and Burgundy ca. 1450.</p>

95,Cession de créance par Charles de Biencourt,838,"<p>In this document Charles de Biencourt, a squire in the French royal stables, agrees to pay to François du Vaulx, seigneur de Plainville, the sum of 210 <em>livres. </em>Biencourt says the same sum is due to him on the promise -- obtained the previous day -- of Georges Le Grand, the Receiver General of the domains of the Queen Mother (Marie de Medici) and Treasurer to the Duke of Nevers, Prince of Mantua. Biencourt gives to Vaulx forty Spanish <em>pistoles</em> (gold coins) as a guarantee, which Vaulx will return to him when Biencourt pays back the 210 <em>livres. </em>Biencourt must have needed the cash more quickly than Le Grand could provide it, and so he turned to a member of his wife’s family for a loan. He had married Gabrielle Plainville three years earlier.</p>
<p>Edward E. Ayer donated this document to the Newberry Library in the early twentieth century. Ayer collected materials relating to European contact with the Americas and had been told (erroneously) that the document pertained to Biencourt’s more well-known cousin, Charles de Biencourt de Poutrincourt, baron de St. Just (1591-1623), colonizer and governor of the colony of Port-Royal in Acadia.</p>

99,Register of notary Guillaume Peytralis for 1582-1583 (part 1),838,"<p>In medieval and Ancien Régime France, notaries would draw up official legal documents for their clients, called <em>minutes</em>, and preserve them in a <em>minutier</em> or notarial register. Notaries kept repertories to help them easily locate deeds across different registers (organized chronologically), and keep track of their clients alphabetically. Notaries sometimes had official copies of <em>minutes</em> made for their clients, called <em>expéditions</em>, such as the <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography:483#96ea133d-672a-4720-ac19-e84182d8b77e"">Expédition du contrat de mariage de Catherine Lobeyrie et Jean Favy</a>.</p>
<p>In our site, we have reproduced three series of deeds found in volume three of a collection of fifteen notarial registers from southern France dating from about 1400 to 1750. The register in volume three covers the years 1582-3 of the study of the notary Guillaume Peytralis, established in the town of Seyne. Among the deeds reproduced are quittances and promises of payment, a contract of apprenticeship, a subletting agreement, and a financial transaction.</p>
<p>In 2005, Jean-Baptiste Raze, then a student at the <em>Ecole des Chartes</em> in Paris, spent a month at the Newberry Library on a short-term fellowship and made a preliminary study of the entire  collection of fifteen registers, which the library had purchased in 1989.</p>
<p>Raze found that three of the registers in the series (numbers 8, 14, and 15) date from the 15th century, were written in Latin, and came from the town of Malaucène. Number 8 belonged to one notary, Girardus Bermundi. Number 14 was used by Bermundi in the fifteenth century and then a hundred years later -by Guillaume Peytralis-, in Seyne. Number 15 is a compilation of several registers written by at least five different notaries, over a period of about 75 years (André de Saint-Romain, Jacques de Saint-Romain, Claude Masson, Thierry Bourgeois, and Antoine Amalric).</p>
<p>Among the remaining twelve registers, two are also from Malaucène, and the other ten are from Seyne. Of the two additional registers from Malaucène, one dates from 1549 and was written in Latin by a notary named Bartholomy Martinelli, and the second one is from 1565, written partly in Latin and partly in French, by a notary named Girardon.</p>
<p>The ten registers from Seyne are actually a mixture of registers and repertories, dating from the 1550s to the 1740s. They are all written in French and belonged to at least two different notaries, Guillaume Peytralis (at least six registers) and Pierre Mathieu (one).</p>

101,Register of notary Guillaume Peytralis for 1582-1583 (part 3),838,"<p>In medieval and Ancien Régime France, notaries would draw up official legal documents for their clients, called <em>minutes</em>, and preserve them in a <em>minutier</em> or notarial register. Notaries kept repertories to help them easily locate deeds across different registers (organized chronologically), and keep track of their clients alphabetically. Notaries sometimes had official copies of <em>minutes</em> made for their clients, called <em>expéditions</em>, such as the <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography:483#96ea133d-672a-4720-ac19-e84182d8b77e"">Expédition du contrat de mariage de Catherine Lobeyrie et Jean Favy</a>.</p>
<p>In our site, we have reproduced three series of deeds found in volume three of a collection of fifteen notarial registers from southern France dating from about 1400 to 1750. The register in volume three covers the years 1582-3 of the study of the notary Guillaume Peytralis, established in the town of Seyne. Among the deeds reproduced are quittances and promises of payment, a contract of apprenticeship, a subletting agreement, and a financial transaction.</p>
<p>In 2005, Jean-Baptiste Raze, then a student at the <em>Ecole des Chartes</em> in Paris, spent a month at the Newberry Library on a short-term fellowship and made a preliminary study of the entire collection of fifteen registers, which the library had purchased in 1989.</p>
<p>Raze found that three of the registers in the series (numbers 8, 14, and 15) date from the 15th century, were written in Latin, and came from the town of Malaucène. Number 8 belonged to one notary, Girardus Bermundi. Number 14 was used by Bermundi in the fifteenth century and then a hundred years later -by Guillaume Peytralis-, in Seyne. Number 15 is a compilation of several registers written by at least five different notaries, over a period of about 75 years (André de Saint-Romain, Jacques de Saint-Romain, Claude Masson, Thierry Bourgeois, and Antoine Amalric).</p>
<p>Among the remaining twelve registers, two are also from Malaucène, and the other ten are from Seyne. Of the two additional registers from Malaucène, one dates from 1549 and was written in Latin by a notary named Bartholomy Martinelli, and the second one is from 1565, written partly in Latin and partly in French, by a notary named Girardon.</p>
<p>The ten registers from Seyne are actually a mixture of registers and repertories, dating from the 1550s to the 1740s. They are all written in French and belonged to at least two different notaries, Guillaume Peytralis (at least six registers) and Pierre Mathieu (one).</p>

103,"Roole des parties payees par maistre Estienne Petit, tresorier et Receveur general des pays de Languedoc et duchié de Guienne par le commandement et ordonnance du Roy nostre seigneur",838,"<p>This document is a treasury account for King Charles VII of France (1403-1461). Drafted by the king’s secretary, Jean de la Loëre, it attests to the reform of the finances of the kingdom of France during the years 1443-47, much needed after years of war and uncontrolled expenses. A series of ordinances reorganized the treasury so that revenues from the royal domain (<em>finances ordinaires</em>) would be separate from the collecting of taxes (<em>finances extraordinaires</em>), whereas in the 13<sup>th</sup> century they had been combined. The reform also redefined the role of financial officers. Now treasurers and generals of finances were each assigned a particular territory to administer, Languedoïl, Languedoc, Seine-et-Yonne, and Normandy.</p>
<p>This account records expenses related to Languedoc, which fell under the jurisdiction of treasurer Etienne Petit (d. 1465). The document is an important source for the history of the administration under King Charles VII, for the payroll lists some of the realm’s most prominent officers, their specific role or contribution, and the amount of their retribution. Jacques Coeur (ca. 1395-1545), the famous merchant who became master of the mint and steward of the royal expenditure after having financed King Charles VII’s wars, appears as a prominent figure, listed no less than four times.</p>
<p>Before ruling as King Charles VII, the son of Charles VI and Isabeau de Bavière was Dauphin of France. He was involved in the assassination of John the Fearless on Montereau Bridge in 1419. Although his father disinherited him in the <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography:449#518e489f-4426-4337-b6ff-1c658fe40463"">Ordinance that appears here</a>, Charles nonetheless officially became king of France in 1429, after the successful intervention of Joan of Arc and a series of campaigns to regain control of the kingdom from the English.</p>

The collection was compiled by Benjamin Franklin Stevens and Henry J. Brown, two bibliophiles based in London, who prepared hundreds of such collections of European, as well as American, historical documents. Their collections were highly popular in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century, and are now found in numerous American repositories. This particular collection once belonged to the Saint Louis industrialist William Keeny Bixley. It contains documents which supposedly all bear the autographs of French kings (or close members of the royal family), although in some instances the signatures were probably imitated by secretaries.</p>

106,Investiture de l’Ile d’Orléans donnée au procureur des concessionnaires par le gouverneur général de la Nouvelle-France,838,"<p>This document records a symbolic moment in Quebec's history: a ceremony that took place at the southwestern tip of the Ile d’Orléans on July 1, 1638. In the presence of local officials and witnesses, Jean Guitet, a notary and clerk in the fledgling colony of New France, read aloud the deeds that accorded two large seignories – land grants – to a newly-formed association of eight French business partners. The document reveals that one part of the ceremony included breaking some branches and pulling up some grass, as a symbol of taking possession of the land.</p>
<p>The trading company chartered to develop the fur trade along the Saint Lawrence River, the <em>Compagnie de la Nouvelle-France </em>or<em> Compagnie des Cent-Associés</em>, had originally issued the deeds of concession two years earlier, in Paris. The <em>Compagnie</em> assigned parcels of land in New France to members who would engage in colonization. Eight of them established a partnership and were granted the seignories of Beaupré and Ile d’Orléans. Their association, known as the <em>Compagnie de Beaupré, </em>would administer those two seignories until the bishop of Quebec, François de Laval, would acquire most of the land in that region, in the 1660s. He needed properties to provide subsistence for the seminary that he was founding. The Seminary of Quebec still owns the seignory of Beaupré, and it still generates revenue.</p>
<p>The document reads like a who's-who of men involved in the early establishment of French commercial interests in North America. It certifies that Guitet read aloud the Paris deeds of concession on site, in the presence of Charles Huault de Montmagny, lieutenant-general of New France. Also present were Huault's lieutenant, Bréhaut Delisle; a representative of the <em>Compagnie de Beaupré, </em>François Derré de Gand; and three witnesses: Juchereau, Pierre Le Roux, and Olivier Le Tardif. Derré took possession of the seignory of the Ile d’Orléans in the name of Jacques Castillon, bourgeois of Paris, and his associates.</p>
<p>Although the associates were not present, the document identifies them: Antoine Cheffault, seigneur de la Regnardière and lawyer in the Parlement of Paris; Nicolas Fouquet and Jean de Lauson, Councilors of State; Georges Berruyer, sieur de Manselmont; and Jean Rozée, Jacques Duhamel, and Noël Juchereau des Chastelets, all merchants.</p>

108,"Traicté des modes, ou tons, de la musique",838,"<p>The musicologist Isabelle His has published a codicological description and detailed account of the contents of this anonymous music manuscript. She observes that one copyist prepared it, writing both the text and music, and that it likely was intended for use in vocal training, keyboard training, or a combination of the two. The scribe may have copied from printed sources which date from as early as the 1550s and at least as late as 1614. The dating and historical context for the manuscript itself is not immediately obvious. The two types of paper used place the manuscript at about 1630 and 1636, and both the paper and the manner of notating the music suggest an English or Dutch locale, London or Amsterdam. But the use of the French language, as well as the musical and theoretical content, point to a Francophone, Calvinist milieu. Paper, of course, could travel, and be saved for later use. Isabelle His points out that there are possible links with another music manuscript by a merchant of La Rochelle – a Calvinist stronghold – named Martin van der Bist d’Anvers, dated 1622.</p>
<p>The document we have digitized is an eight-page treatise on the musical modes found at the beginning of the manuscript. The inclusion of such a treatise is unusual for a music manuscript of this period and for one that contains so much keyboard repertoire. The author of the treatise, clearly influenced by the writings of the French composer Claude Le Jeune (who died in 1600), defends the value of the ancient system of twelve modes as compared with the pared-down “modern” system of only eight modes, drawing examples from the Huguenot Psalter. Isabelle His comments that there’s more scholarly work to be done to tease out the relationship between the treatise that opens the manuscript and the musical repertoire that follows.</p>

110,Vers d'amour,838,"<p>The 19th-century poet, editor, and bookseller Prosper Blanchemain found this manuscript in a Paris bookshop and used it as the base text for his 1873 edition of the poems of Jehan (Jean) Marion (Blanchemain’s volume is available <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=7VIdcOkrzMwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=%22jehan+marion%22&ots=6minsTBHUD&sig=Vbwc1VJbEXzLlLM8Floraj3dOGc#v=onepage&q=%22jehan%20marion%22&f=false"">online</a>). The manuscript bears Blanchemain’s bookplate. Only 100 numbered copies of Blanchemain’s edition of it were printed.</p>
<p>The manuscript contains a set of verses (which the author claims to have rendered out of prose) on questions pertaining to love, a French translation of a Latin poem admonishing children to draw near to Jesus Christ, and an assortment of other poems in various formats that were popular in the 15th and first half of the 16th century in France (<em>rondeaux, quatrains, huitains, ballades,</em> etc.). Blanchemain assumes that the manuscript is in Marion’s own hand. This seems very likely, but we don’t know for sure. Whoever the scribe was, there appears to have been an intention to put the most important poems – the more scholarly ones – at the beginning. But as Blanchemain remarks, the smaller poems assembled at the end are more representative of Marion himself, as a poet and personality.</p>
<p>This manuscript is the only document through which we know of this poet’s existence – there do not appear to have been any printed editions of his verses prior to Blanchemain’s discovery of the manuscript. It's possible that Marion moved in the kinds of social circles that would have caused some of his verses to be set to music, in which case they might appear in published or manuscript anthologies of <em>chansons</em>. This remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Fortunately Jehan Marion provides his name internally in the collection, in several places, including the acrostic poem that we have reproduced, where his name is presented vertically in the initials at the beginning of the lines (fol. 37r). Working from the first-person material in the poems, which appears to be autobiographical, Blanchemain concluded that this poet must have been the Jean Marion who was the fifth son (born in 1540) of a notary in Nevers, in Burgundy. An itinerant schoolmaster in his youth, he returned regularly to his home town, where he eventually married, had a son who lived for only a week, became a magistrate, and died in about 1579 or 1580. The Count of Soultrait, however, argued to Blanchemain (in a letter that Blanchemain reproduced at the end of his edition) that this was Jean Marion, the son of a goldsmith in Nevers named Pierre Marion, who, after a rather peripatetic youthful existence, later went to serve as a soldier in Poland under the Duke of Anjou. In short, this may have been the impoverished cousin of the more important branch of the family – that is, the more colorful figure of the bohemian poet-soldier. We like to think of these verses as being read aloud or sung on the road, and so we have included in our website an out-loud reading of the acrostic poem (click <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography:2411"">here</a>).</p>

368,Les xv joies Nostre Dame,838,"<p>Books of Hours, the most common type of late medieval illuminated manuscripts, assisted lay women and men in their private devotions. These books offer a shortened version of the Divine Office, the devotions performed by monks and nuns at the eight canonical hours each day. Books of Hours usually also contain a liturgical calendar showing the saints days celebrated throughout the year. Since the Virgin Mary was central to medieval spiritual devotion, the Hours of the Virgin, or Little Office of the Blessed Virgin, was the main text of Books of Hours. Often the “Joys of the Virgin” appears as well, a prayer commemorating anywhere from five to fifteen happy moments in Mary’s life, although seven ""joys"" is the most common. This prayer is usually the only part of the manuscript in French, apart from the calendar, since the main text of Books of Hours is in Latin. The Latin and French texts vary slightly according to the liturgy practiced in a particular region, known as its “use,"" such as the Uses of Rome and Paris.</p>

567,Cartulaire de l'Abbaye-aux-Bois,2482,"<p>In the forest of Picardy, near Compiègne and Noyon, stood the Abbaye-aux-Bois, a monastery of Cistercian nuns, from 1202 to 1661. After a fire burnt the abbey down, the small community moved to Paris and continued its mission until 1907, when the Paris convent was destroyed in the expansion of the Rue de Sèvres. Amazingly, a large portion of the archives of the community survived, including this cartulary from the 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> centuries, which found its way to Chicago.</p>
<p>This cartulary is a collection of 247 charters dated 1202 to 1279 and mostly related to the possessions of the monastery.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""" id=""_ftnref2"">[2]</a> While Latin dominates, French is the language of the seven charters presented here and of 45 more charters written from 1251 onwards. A first part of the cartulary was complete by 1243 (fol. 13r-42v), and a second part, ca. 1280. Further additions were made in 1296 and in 1314. Finally, a table akin to a user’s guide was created in 1341 (fol. 1-8).</p>
<p>In modern times the monastery is known as <em>Abbaye-aux-Bois</em>, but in the Middle Ages it was most commonly called <em>Libera Abbatia/Franche-Abbaye</em> or <em>Libera Abbatia juxta Bellum Locum/Franche Abbaye delez Beaulieu</em>, as it was tied to the village of Beaulieu-les-Fontaines.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""" id=""_ftnref3"">[3]</a> In the sample presented here, we find the words “Franche Abie de(les) Biauliu” in five charters, and “Franke Abbeie du Bos en costé Biaulieu” in two others.</p>
<p>The cartulary opens with the foundation charter of April 1202. Jean II, <em>seigneur de Nesle </em>and<em> châtelain de Bruges</em> (1197-1239) appears to have founded the abbey in the interval between taking a crusade vow in 1200 and departing for the Fourth Crusade in 1203. A large number of charters pertain to him and his family, including the charter on <a href=""https://paleography.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/paleography%3A2055#3f95e7a2-31d4-4f4a-8869-9a9579911843"">fol. 72v</a>, which is the first one written in French. Here Jean de Nelse, lord of Falvy and nephew of Jean II de Nesle, pledges to pay one <em>muid</em> of wheat to the monastery every year when his vassal Gautier le Maçon or Gautier's heirs are unable to do so (see the transcription here).</p>
<p>This cartulary is the earliest document in this website's collection. For an example of a much later cartulary (1693), see <a href=""/islandora/object/paleography%3A1809#23f97e71-5de0-4ba9-a60d-238db9a77d0c"">Contracts, charters, financial records of the St. Lambert’s Cathedral in Liège</a>.</p>

602,Chronique de Normandie,2488,"<p>The <em>Chronique de Normandie</em> recounts the deeds of the medieval dukes of Normandy. The first version of this prose chronicle drew on a long tradition of historiographical writing celebrating the dukes of Normandy that began in the late 10<sup>th</sup> century. By the 13<sup>th</sup> century, Latin and French verse histories of the dukes (by such authors as Dudon, Guillaume of Jumièges, Orderic Vital, Wace, Benoît of Saint-Maure, and others) had fallen out of style and were replaced by a prose vernacular version, likely due to the influence and popularity of contemporary prose Crusade chronicles. The anonymous French prose chronicle composed in the 13<sup>th</sup> century drew heavily on earlier Latin and vernacular sources while elaborating on the events described and bringing the chronicle up to date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Later, in the 14<sup>th</sup> century, another anonymous author/compiler further revised and expanded the 13<sup>th</sup>-century prose <em>Chronique de Normandie</em>; modern scholars sometimes call this 14<sup>th</sup>-century version the <em>Grande Chronique de Normandie </em>to differentiate it from its predecessor. This later text is the one conserved in the Getty Museum manuscript. Scholars have divided the surviving manuscripts of the 14<sup>th</sup>-century chronicle into two text families: manuscripts of Family A, like the Getty’s copy, lack the two introductory chapters that are found in manuscripts of Family B. Overall, 43 manuscript copies of the 14<sup>th</sup>-century chronicle are known today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Getty’s copy of the <em>Chronique de Normandie</em> is an elaborate manuscript incorporating painted miniatures, marginal decoration, and large decorated initials. The miniatures depict major events from the chronicle, such as the coronation of William I (popularly known as William the Conqueror, identified as “guillaume le bastart” in the inscription) illustrated on folio 91v. Most of the miniatures utilize a technique known as “grisaille,” or painting with shades of gray instead of color. Manuscripts using grisaille were particularly in vogue among the French royal family in the 14<sup>th</sup> century, and the Dukes of Burgundy continued to favor the technique in the 15<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two of the decorated initials in this manuscript contain armorial devices that allow us to posit the identities of the two people who originally commissioned (or received?) the manuscript: David de Rambures and Guillaume de Bours. The two men were friends who served as counselors for various dukes and kings, including King Philip the Bold. Both men were killed at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, one of the major battles of the Hundred Years’ War.</p>

604,Book of Esther (beginning),2488,"<p>Petrus Comestor’s 12<sup>th</sup>-century -century <em>Historia Scholastica</em> was already a popular text, widely used in learned and clerical milieus, when the canon Guyart de Moulins translated it into French in the late thirteenth century. The result of Guyart’s enormous undertaking is the <em>Bible Historiale, </em>a history of the world based on the events of the Bible. Guyart de Moulins’s vernacular translation found immense success in the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries, and approximately 150 manuscript copies of the <em>Bible</em> <em>Historiale</em> survive today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This two-volume manuscript in the Getty Museum exhibits the standard decoration and layout for luxury copies of the <em>Bible Historiale</em>: a large frontispiece opens each volume and numerous single-column miniatures illustrate the text. Most of the chapters in the <em>Bible Historiale </em>are introduced by a miniature depicting an event near the beginning of that book or, as is the case with the miniature on folio 262r introducing the Book of Esther, an image that encapsulates the theme or subject matter of that book. The crowned figure of Esther appears before King Ahasuerus in an apt opening miniature for this text centered on Esther’s role in saving the Jewish people from destruction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nothing is known of the original patron or owner of the manuscript, but the style of the miniatures permits us to identify the painter as the “Master of John de Mandeville.” This otherwise anonymous artist takes his name from a luxury copy of Mandeville’s <em>Travels</em> that he illustrated for King Charles V (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, MS nouv. ac. fr. 4515-4516). The artist was active in the courts of King Charles V and John the Good (Jean le Bon) in the third quarter of the 14<sup>th</sup> century, and his style is typical of elite 14<sup>th</sup>-century Parisian production. The artist used a partial grisaille (gray painting) technique, with touches of color for the faces and hands, to portray the elegant and fashionably dressed figures of Ahasuerus, Esther, and her attendants. In addition to this manuscript, the Master of John de Mandeville is known to have illustrated at least two other copies of the <em>Bible Historiale. </em></p>

605,Le roman de Tristan de Léonois,2488,"<p>While nothing is known of the original patrons of this copy of <em>Le roman de Tristan de Léonois</em>, we have the rare advantage of being able to identify the artist responsible for the illuminations found throughout this manuscript. Based on surviving tax records, colophons found in related manuscripts, and stylistic analysis of this and other books, we know that the artist of the Getty <em>Roman de Tristan</em> was a woman named Jeanne de Montbaston. Along with her husband Richard, Jeanne de Montbaston was a <em>libraire </em>or bookmaker in Paris in the first half of the 14<sup>th</sup> century; together, the two were responsible for creating at least 50 known manuscripts. The Getty <em>Tristan </em>is the product of the commercial book trade and, as was typical, multiple artisans were involved in its creation: scholars have discerned the hands of at least two scribes and four artists. By necessity, artists like Jeanne and Richard often had to prioritize quantity over time-consuming details, and the sketchy, minimalist quality of some of the illustrations in the Getty <em>Tristan</em> attest to the speed at which these artists worked. This large manuscript of 388 folios contains 89 illuminations in all, though a note at the end of the book indicates it was meant to have even more, for a total of 127.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like the Newberry Library’s prose <em>Lancelot du Lac</em> (Newberry VAULT folio Case MS 21), the Getty’s <em>Roman de Tristan </em>is an Old French prose romance composed in the first quarter of the 13<sup>th</sup> century. Also like the prose Lancelot, the text is a lengthy elaboration of earlier legends that circulated orally and in verse form during the 12<sup>th</sup> century (and perhaps even earlier). The prose <em>Roman de Tristan</em> reworked existing stories of Tristan’s love affair with Isolde and his deeds of knightly prowess, integrating the hero into the world of King Arthur’s court and thus updating the hero for a 13<sup>th</sup>-century audience. In the prose <em>Roman de Tristan</em>, the titular hero becomes the friend (and sometimes competitor) of Lancelot, though they do not often meet. Lancelot’s adulterous passion for King Arthur’s wife Guinevere provides an obvious parallel with Tristan’s illicit love for Queen Isolde, the wife of King Mark of Cornwall. </p>

631,Fables and other poems,2488,"<p>This spectacular manuscript contains illustrated fables put into verse by Pierre Sala, a gentleman of the city of Lyons. The manuscript is dedicated to Louise of Savoy and was prepared in about 1515, the year in which her son became King François I. Sala had served as a squire in the households of the two preceding kings, Louis XII and Charles VIII, which occasioned travel to Spain and Italy for him as well as throughout France. In 1515 Sala was nearing the age of 60, and he retired to Lyons, where he had one home in the city and another in the countryside. François I later visited Sala to view his remarkable collection of more than 100 books. It seems doubtful, but legend has it that Sala also acquired antiquities by carrying out archaeological digs in the Roman ruins on his country property.</p>
<p>The Morgan Library holds another manuscript, this one prepared <em>for</em> Sala, the <a href=""http://corsair.morganlibrary.org/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&Search_Arg=osin+%22ms+M+277%22&Search_Code=CMD&CNT=50&HIST=1""><em>Dits moraux des philosophes</em></a>, which contains moral sayings of the Greek philosophers transcribed from the <em>Mer des hystoires</em>, a book printed in Paris in 1488. That book, in turn, was a translation of a Latin work compiled in Lubeck in 1475. So Sala's career as writer and collector demonstrates the porous nature of the relationship between manuscript and print in the years around 1500.</p>
